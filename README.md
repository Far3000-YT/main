# Java Project Management App (3 persons worked on this)

It is almost fully functionnal (some functionalities are missing but I prefer advancing on other projects, so I'll not implement them for now) + you need docker and the springboot java project (https://github.com/Far3000-YT/project-management-app-api) for the database / backend api to make this work !!

Demo (everything you see in that video uses the local springboot api and database, so everything I did used a request, each task I add, each member i update... etc) :
