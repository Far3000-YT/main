# Java Project Management App (3 persons worked on this)

It is almost fully functionnal (some functionalities missing but can't fix them / too lazy to finish it because java is unfunny !!) + you need docker and the springboot java project (https://github.com/Far3000-YT/project-management-app-api) for the database to make this work !!

Demo (everything you see in that video uses the local springboot api and database, so everything I did used a request, each task I add, each member i update... etc) :
